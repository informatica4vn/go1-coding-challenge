To tackle the problem of identifying the easiest question in a multiple-choice quiz, we'll break down the steps required to analyze and compute the result. This involves comparing the correct answers to the learners' responses and determining which question has the highest number of correct responses.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Create a counter or a list to keep track of the number of correct answers for each question. The length of this list should be equal to the number of questions in the quiz.

2. **Compare Responses to Answers**: Iterate through each learner's responses and compare each response to the corresponding correct answer. If a response matches the correct answer, increment the counter for that question.

3. **Determine the Easiest Question**: After processing all the responses, identify the question with the highest count in your counter. This represents the question that the most learners answered correctly.

4. **Return the Index of the Easiest Question**: Since the requirement is to return the index, ensure that the index is formatted according to common conventions (typically zero-based, but specify based on requirements).

### Example and Pseudocode

Using the given example:
- Correct Answers: `["A", "B", "C"]`
- Learner Responses: `[
    ["A", "B", "B"],
    ["C", "B", "C"],
    ["A", "B", "C"],
    ["B", "B", "A"],
    ["A", "B", "C"]
]`

#### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function findEasiestQuestion(correctAnswers, learnerResponses):
    correctCounts = [0] * len(correctAnswers)  # Initialize the counter

    # Iterate through each response from learners
    for responses in learnerResponses:
        for i, response in enumerate(responses):
            if response == correctAnswers[i]:
                correctCounts[i] += 1  # Increment the count for correct answers

    # Find the index of the maximum value in correctCounts
    easiestIndex = correctCounts.index(max(correctCounts))

    return f"The easiest question is index {easiestIndex}"
```

### Detailed Explanation for the Given Example

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `correctCounts = [0, 0, 0]`

2. **Processing Responses**:
   - First learner: `["A", "B", "B"]` matches questions 1 and 2 correctly.
   - Second learner: `["C", "B", "C"]` matches question 2 correctly.
   - Third learner: `["A", "B", "C"]` matches all questions correctly.
   - Fourth learner: `["B", "B", "A"]` matches question 2 correctly.
   - Fifth learner: `["A", "B", "C"]` matches all questions correctly.
   - Updated `correctCounts` after all responses: `[3, 5, 2]`

3. **Finding the Easiest Question**:
   - The maximum value in `correctCounts` is 5, corresponding to the second question (index 1).

4. **Output**:
   - `The easiest question is index 1`.

This method efficiently identifies the question most learners find easiest by simply counting and comparing correct responses, providing clear and actionable insights into the quiz's difficulty distribution.
