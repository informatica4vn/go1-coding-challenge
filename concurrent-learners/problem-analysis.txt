This problem is about determining the maximum number of overlapping time intervals, which is a common type of problem in areas such as scheduling, networking, or any domain where you need to find the peak load or maximum resource utilization. Let's break down the steps to solve this problem efficiently:

### Approach

1. **Event Point Transformation**:
   - Transform each user's streaming interval into two "events": one for the start and one for the end. The start event can increase the count of concurrent streams, and the end event can decrease it.
   - For example, for a user streaming from 500 to 1500, we generate two events: `(500, 'start')` and `(1500, 'end')`.

2. **Sorting Events**:
   - Sort these events primarily by the timestamp. If two events have the same timestamp, the 'end' event should come before the 'start' event to handle cases where one stream ends at the same time another starts without incorrectly counting them as overlapping.

3. **Sweep Line Algorithm**:
   - Traverse through these sorted events, maintaining a count of concurrent streams. Increment the count for a 'start' event and decrement for an 'end' event.
   - Track the maximum count during this sweep to determine the maximum number of concurrent streams.

### Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode based on the approach described:

```plaintext
function findMaxConcurrentStreams(streams):
    events = []

    # Transform each stream interval into two events
    for stream in streams:
        events.append((stream[1], 'start'))  # stream[1] is the start time
        events.append((stream[2], 'end'))    # stream[2] is the end time

    # Sort events, handling ties by placing 'end' before 'start'
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'start'))

    max_concurrent = 0
    current_concurrent = 0

    # Sweep through events to find maximum concurrent streams
    for event in events:
        if event[1] == 'start':
            current_concurrent += 1
        else:
            current_concurrent -= 1

        max_concurrent = max(max_concurrent, current_concurrent)

    return "The maximum number of concurrent streams is " + str(max_concurrent) + "."
```

This approach ensures that you efficiently find the maximum number of concurrent streams with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of events (twice the number of streams). Would you like to go into more details about any specific part of this pseudocode, or perhaps try implementing it in a particular programming language?

The time and space complexity of the program that calculates the maximum number of concurrent streams can be analyzed based on the major steps involved in the solution:

### Time Complexity

1. **Event Creation**: For each stream, we create two events (start and end). This operation is linear with respect to the number of streams, so if there are \( n \) streams, we generate \( 2n \) events. This step has a complexity of \( O(n) \).

2. **Sorting Events**: The most significant operation in terms of complexity is sorting these \( 2n \) events. The sorting of these events, depending on the sorting algorithm used (typically \( O(n \log n) \) for efficient comparison-based sorts like mergesort or heapsort), dominates the time complexity. Therefore, sorting takes \( O(2n \log (2n)) \), which simplifies to \( O(n \log n) \) since constants and multiplicative factors are omitted in Big O notation.

3. **Processing Events**: We then sweep through these sorted events, incrementing or decrementing a counter as we encounter start and end events, respectively. This is linear with respect to the number of events, \( O(2n) \), which simplifies to \( O(n) \).

Combining these, the overall time complexity of the program is dominated by the sorting step, making it \( O(n \log n) \).

### Space Complexity

1. **Event Storage**: We store \( 2n \) events in a list. This storage is the primary space usage in the program.

2. **Counters and Other Variables**: We also maintain a few integers to track the current number of concurrent streams and the maximum found. This usage is minimal compared to the list of events.

Therefore, the space complexity of the program is \( O(n) \), as the largest data structure in use is the list that holds the \( 2n \) events.

In summary, the program has a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \) due to sorting and a space complexity of \( O(n) \) due to the event list. This makes it efficient for scenarios with a large number of streams, as the logarithmic factor in the time complexity allows it to handle growth in input size gracefully.
