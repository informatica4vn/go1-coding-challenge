A solid follow-up question to explore scaling the overlapping streams problem could involve handling massive datasets, which is a common challenge in many real-world applications such as big data analysis, network traffic monitoring, or large-scale event management. Here’s how you might frame such a question:

### Follow-Up Question on Scaling

**"Imagine this algorithm is now required to handle data from millions of users streaming concurrently, with the data input arriving in real time. How would you modify your current solution to efficiently process and update the maximum number of concurrent streams dynamically as new data arrives? Consider both the computational limitations and the need for almost instantaneous results."**

This question challenges the candidate to think about several key aspects:

1. **Real-time Data Processing**: The candidate needs to consider how to handle data that is continuously updating, rather than processing a static dataset.

2. **Efficiency at Scale**: With the dramatic increase in the volume of data, the candidate needs to discuss more efficient data structures or algorithms that can handle large-scale data more effectively, possibly discussing distributed systems or parallel processing.

3. **Dynamic Updates**: The question also involves updating the maximum number of concurrent streams dynamically as new streams start or end, which might lead the candidate to consider using advanced data structures like Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or Segment Trees, which are efficient for such range queries and updates.

4. **Latency and Performance**: Considering the requirement for almost instantaneous results, the candidate should discuss optimizations and technologies that minimize latency and maximize performance, such as using in-memory databases, stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink, or even hardware optimizations.

This follow-up question not only tests the candidate’s technical knowledge and problem-solving skills but also assesses their ability to apply these skills to practical, real-world scenarios where performance and efficiency are critical.
